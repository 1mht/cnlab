    "Abnormal activities are often difficult to detect amongst the amount of legitimate traffic that is typically found in a large enterprise network. Malicious hosts might not show up in lists of the top senders (either by bytes or by flows), and it can be difficult to determine the exact nature of attack traffic in advance. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, certain types of attacks have characteristic features that simplify their detection. For example, many attackers attempt to detect hosts running vulnerable services by scanning the address space using TCP SYN packets.  If a NetFlow record indicates that a flow contained a TCP SYN packet _but no packets with the ACK flag set_, we can conclude that this flow never completed and thus may be part of a TCP SYN scan---particularly if there are a lot of these flows.\n",

    "When an attacker sends a TCP SYN packet as part of a TCP SYN scan, there are three possible outcomes:\n",
    "- There is an active host at the destination IP address that is listening on the destination port of the SYN packet. In this case, the NetFlow record will contain both the TCP SYN and ACK flags in the flow record. These flows are difficult to distinguish from legitimate flows, because in this case a host actually answered the initial SYN. \n",
    "- There is no active host on the network at the destination IP address. In this case, we will only see TCP SYN flag. This is very different from the legitimate traffic behavior. It should be possible to identify malicious scanners by identifying these flows.\n",
    "- The destination is alive, but the port to which the SYN is sent is closed. If a client connects to a server's non-listening port, the server will send back a RST/ACK packet. According to normal TCP implementation guidelines, the scanner will immediately stop any TCP connection attempts once it receives a RST. Like in the previous case, the NetFlow record will show SYN requests from the scanner host to the destination host but no SYN/ACK packets in response."

    "In the previous sections, we used offline analysis of pre-recorded traffic to identify potentially malicious hosts. A real network operator would not want to wait for offline analysis in order to detect potential threats.  Instead, he or she would configure a network intrusion detection system (NIDS) to use an online port scan detection algorithm to classify hosts as benign or malicious, updating these classifications in real-time as traffic flows occur. \n",

    "The port scan detection algorithm used in the [Bro system](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f121/cde8d3d5364717caf2b91d27a270ec004cac.pdf) was published in 1999 by Vern Paxson, et al.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bro's detection algorithm builds on the same intution that failed connection attempts (SYN-only or SYN/RST flows) are good indicators for identifying scans.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm treats connection attempts differently depending on the service (determined by port) to which the connection is intended.  Bro only tracks failed connection attempts (SYN-only or SYN/RST) to a specific set of \"known good\" services.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all other services, Bro tracks all connection attempts, whether or not the attempts fail or succeed. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each sending host, Bro counts the number of distinct destination addresses corresponding to tracked connection attempts. If the number exceeds some threshold, `T`, Bro flags the host as a scanner.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the set of services for which only failures are considered includes HTTP (80), SSH (22), Telnet (23), SMTP (25), IDENT (113), FTP (20), and Gopher (70). These services are \"known good,\" i.e. we expect many connections to be initiated to these services, so we should not count successful connection attempts against a sending host. \n",

    "\n",
    "**为什么选择阈值100：**\n",
    "\n",
    "从敏感性曲线图可以观察到：\n",
    "- 当阈值很低（0-20）时，被阻止的主机数量非常多（可能超过数千），这会产生大量误报\n",
    "- 当阈值在20-100区间时，被阻止的主机数量急剧下降\n",
    "- 当阈值超过100后，曲线趋于平缓，被阻止的主机数量变化不大（约115个左右）\n",
    "\n",
    "选择100作为默认阈值是因为：\n",
    "1. 它位于曲线的\"拐点\"区域，在这个点之后增加阈值带来的收益递减\n",
    "2. 一个主机连接超过100个不同的目标地址是非常可疑的行为\n",
    "\n",
    "**更高阈值的优缺点：**\n",
    "- **优点**：减少误报率（False Positive），避免阻止正常的高活跃用户\n",
    "- **缺点**：可能漏检一些真正的扫描器（False Negative），降低检测敏感度\n",
    "\n",
    "**更低阈值的优缺点：**\n",
    "- **优点**：能检测到更多的扫描器，提高检测敏感度\n",
    "- **缺点**：会产生更多误报，可能阻止正常用户流量，增加管理负担"

   "source": [
    "#### Answer 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bro算法与Part B方法的主要差异：**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **检测标准不同**：\n",
    "   - Part B方法：将任何发送SYN-only流量或访问已知恶意端口的主机都标记为恶意\n",
    "   - Bro算法：需要主机连接超过阈值T个不同的目标地址才标记为恶意\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **服务端口处理不同**：\n",
    "   - Part B方法：只区分\"已知恶意端口\"和\"其他端口\"\n",
    "   - Bro算法：对\"已知良好服务\"（如HTTP、SSH等）只跟踪失败连接，对其他服务跟踪所有连接\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **阈值机制**：\n",
    "   - Part B方法：没有阈值，一次可疑行为即标记为恶意\n",
    "   - Bro算法：需要多次可疑行为（超过阈值）才标记为恶意\n",
    "\n",
    "**哪种方法更准确：**\n",
    "\n",
    "Bro算法可能更准确，原因如下：\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **减少误报**：正常主机偶尔也会产生SYN-only流（如网络超时），Part B会错误标记这些主机。Bro的阈值机制能过滤这些偶发情况。\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **考虑服务特性**：Bro对常用服务（如HTTP）区别对待，允许正常的连接失败，减少对合法用户的误判。\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **行为模式识别**：真正的端口扫描器会向大量不同目标发送探测包。Bro通过计数不同目标地址来识别这种模式，比简单的流量特征更能反映攻击意图。\n",
    "\n",
    "然而，Bro也可能漏检那些扫描目标数量较少但仍然恶意的攻击者。实际应用中，可能需要结合多种方法以获得更好的检测效果。"
